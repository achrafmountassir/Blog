Hi, I’m Achraf, a vulnerability researcher enthusiast based in Morocco, I am eager to learn about anything related to hacking, reverse engineering, or programming. I also like to share what I’ve learned and that’s why this blog is for. I hope you have a great time and if you would like to get in touch via Email or LinkedIn, I am always up for a chat about offensive security!
